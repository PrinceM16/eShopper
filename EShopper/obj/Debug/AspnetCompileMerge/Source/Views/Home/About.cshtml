                    The indefinite article takes two forms.
                    It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant.
                    It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel.
                    The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing.
                    For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?”
                    Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item.
                    “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you.
                    Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie.
                    Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet.

                    There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words that begin with vowels.
                    The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced.
                    In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an.
                    Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this concept.

                    Similarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound.
